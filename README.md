# Snippets

### About

This is dead simple.

*Snippets* is a collection of useful snippets for Sys admins, DevOps, Developers, power users, drunk people with a keyboard and everyone in between. 

By the way, it has never meant to be useful to any of them.

### Usage

Although some scripts are ready for execution, I made it that way just for demo purpose.

Those are snippets, so just take what you need!

### License

Like everything out there, even this needs a licence. 

I release the code in this repo under the GNU GPLv3 License by Francesco Pira (dev[at]fpira[dot]com, fpira.com). You can read the terms of the license [here](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html). I think it is a nice way to set it truly free and let it run in the wild.
