/* In your custom.css try this */

.navbar-inverse .navbar-nav>li>a:hover {
    color: #707070;
}
.navbar-inverse .navbar-nav>li>a {
    color: #000;
}

/* (P.S. It's a bit hard to determine what exactly will work because you haven't provided the HTML that this CSS is applied to. I had to look at your github repo views erbs to determine that you are using .navbar-inverse. if you had a working page to link to or a jsfiddle, that would be even better.) */
